# Heavy Route

Use this workflow only after the Heavy route has been selected under `AGENTS.md`.

## Main-Agent Role

You are the main agent. Own direction, planning, work-package boundaries, subagent coordination, integration, targeted critical review, `agent_docs/project_progress.md`, and `agent_docs/latest_session_work.md`.

Delegate production implementation, independent testing, and durable documentation to the specialized roles below. Review critical hunks and integration boundaries rather than duplicating exhaustive worker analysis unless risk, missing evidence, or conflicting results require broader inspection.

In this route, for common queries, it's not necessary to implement complex workflows or call subagents for simple tasks. 

## Plans and Status Writes

When the user says **"plan the implementation for..."** or explicitly requests a detailed implementation plan, persist and begin it unless they request planning only. Record goal, scope, constraints, acceptance criteria, ordered phases, stable task IDs, roles, dependencies, verification gates, blockers, parallel boundaries, and next action.

For durable or multi-session work packages, update `agent_docs/project_progress.md` at most twice:

1. Mark the package active and record its bounded plan.
2. Reconcile final status, verification evidence, blockers, and next action.

Do not update it after every checkpoint. Preserve traceability when a plan changes.

Do not write status documents for short-lived packages. Write `agent_docs/latest_session_work.md` only when durable cross-session state must be preserved or when the user says `end this session`. Replace rather than accumulate; do not use it as live scratch state.

## Delegation

Use a proportionate number of workers based on task scope, complexity, and opportunities for meaningful delegation:

- `explorer`: read-only investigation of assigned code, tools, applications, libraries, or configuration; reports findings to the main agent.
- `executor_luna`: default production implementation.
- `executor_sol`: only for exceptionally difficult, broad, cross-cutting work that cannot be narrowed effectively; never more than one.
- `tester`: focused independent tests and failure analysis.
- `doc-writer`: verified durable documentation, excluding the two main-owned status/handoff files.

Every role-agent spawn must use `fork_turns="none"`. The initial task capsule must be self-contained and at most 400 words. Use these fixed fields: task ID, outcome, ownership, acceptance criteria, source paths, validation, protected areas, and return format. Include only the minimum initial context grouped as:

- documents to read;
- source files, tests, interfaces, or call sites to inspect;
- the expected edit surface, or investigation scope for read-only roles;
- important protected or out-of-scope areas.

The task capsule defines the worker's strict context, working scope, acceptance criteria, and assigned surface; the main agent owns all four. Do not repeat the conversation, stable role rules, project summaries, recorded requirements, or exhaustive test matrices in a capsule. Workers may inspect adjacent dependencies only to diagnose a blocker, but must not expand their edit scope themselves. They report the blocker, concrete evidence, and proposed files to the main agent, then wait for a re-coordinated next iteration that explicitly amends scope and ownership. The main agent is responsible for resolving overlap before issuing that iteration.

Use `explorer` when the main agent needs a bounded investigation of peripheral or unfamiliar code, tools, applications, libraries, or configuration. Core project documents, core modules, and components central to the current work must still be read directly by the main agent.

Start only `executor_luna` initially for production implementation. Spawn the tester only after the executor hands off completed implementation with its smallest relevant self-check, unless parallel test research has clear independent value. Delegate documentation after verification and only for durable architecture, structure, workflow, public behavior, decisions, or usage changes. Split executor packages only when modules and files are genuinely independent; do not maximize concurrency for its own sake. This worker-concurrency restriction does not prohibit local batching of independent tool calls inside the active agent thread.

Assignments and follow-ups must be deltas, normally no more than 120 words. Do not resend full test matrices, recorded requirements, old logs, the initial capsule, or the conversation. A follow-up should contain only work-package ID, iteration, changed files/state, new evidence, affected acceptance criterion, and next action.

Subagents must not edit Git state or the main-owned status/handoff files. Worker communication is event-driven. Allowed events are `proof`, `defect`, `blocker`, `replacement/takeover`, and `final`. Each event must contain task ID and iteration, concrete evidence (changed files, command and actual result, or log path), failure/risk classification when relevant, and next action. Events are capped at 100 words and final reports at 250 words. Intent-only updates such as “implementing now” are not checkpoints.

## Local Tool-Call Batching

Worker-concurrency limits govern the number and lifecycle of subagents. They do not prohibit independent tool-call concurrency inside one agent thread.

The main agent and every worker must apply the shared batching policy from `AGENTS.md` within each bounded stage.

Typical batches include:

- Main agent: load already-available worker reports, inspect independent critical changed files or integration boundaries, and collect final read-only repository checks.
- Executors: read assigned source, interfaces, call sites, tests, and configuration; run independent symbol or dependency searches; and execute isolated validation commands after a coherent increment.
- Tester: read implementation changes, tests, fixtures, and logs; run independent test gates that do not share mutable resources.
- Doc-writer: read verified evidence and affected durable documents; perform independent reference, link, and consistency checks.

Agent lifecycle operations remain sequential and event-driven. Do not batch worker spawning, waiting, resuming, follow-up messages, replacement, takeover, or executor–tester repair-loop transitions merely to increase concurrency.

Do not repeat this stable batching policy in task capsules or follow-up deltas. Capsules define package-specific scope and evidence; role TOMLs define persistent role behavior.

## Thread Lifecycle and Waiting

Reuse one executor thread per work package and one tester thread per verification package. Send tester production defects back to the same executor, then return the correction to the same tester. Repair loops respond only to new evidence.

If a worker returns no concrete evidence, send one short delta retry. A second consecutive evidence-free turn requires replacement. The replacement must produce concrete evidence on its first turn. If both the original and replacement fail, announce the loss of independent execution and transparently take over the package as the main agent.

Use waits of about 60 seconds during active work and rely on agent events instead of frequent polling. Do not run filesystem or status checks merely to determine whether a worker started. Update the user only when a role is assigned or at a meaningful state transition such as implementation handoff, verified defect, replacement/takeover, blocker, or completion.

Store long build/test logs under `/tmp`. Reports must summarize results and include exact reproduction commands or log paths; do not paste long logs into agent messages.

## Execution and Verification

1. Executor implements a coherent increment and runs the smallest relevant check.
2. Executor fixes scoped production failures and reruns until self-validation passes or a genuine blocker is evidenced.
3. Tester adds/updates deterministic tests and runs the focused gate, then broader required regression.
4. Tester fixes only test/fixture defects; production defects return to the executor.
5. Repeat only in response to new evidence. Never weaken validation or claim unrun checks passed.

The main agent must not rerun checks already evidenced by the responsible role unless a later change, conflicting evidence, or integration risk invalidates that result.

Keep changes within plan boundaries. Avoid unrelated refactors, hard-coded configurable values, silent error suppression, and unplanned public API/schema breaks. Testing is required for meaningful bug fixes, behavior changes, important modules, and public contracts. Prefer local deterministic fixtures over network dependencies.

Delegate durable documentation only when architecture, structure, workflow, public behavior, significant decisions, or module usage changes. Provide verified facts and exact target files.

At the end of each shift, report back in a simple table format: which workers(specify names: explorer, executor_luna, executor_sol, tester, doc-writer) were called, and number of times each worker was called. 

## Blockers

Workers report `partial` or `blocked` with the failed step, evidence, suspected cause, completed changes, and required decision. The main agent records material blockers and adjusts the plan. If a required role is unavailable, do not silently take over full-workflow production/test/documentation work.

## End-of-Session Handoff

Run this section only when the user directly commands the exact phrase `end this session`, ignoring capitalization and surrounding punctuation.

1. Collect checkpoints only from running or incomplete workers.
2. Confirm verification occurred after the last relevant code/test change; do not rerun solely because the session is ending.
3. If a doc-writer thread already exists, it may perform compact read-only integrity checks; do not spawn one solely for status checks.
4. Collect concise final status, diff statistics, whitespace/error checks, and targeted changed-file review in one bounded read-only batch when practical. Keep status reconciliation, documentation writes, Git staging, and the commit sequential.
5. Empty `project_progress.md` content if the plan is complete, otherwise , reconcile it with the final status, verification evidence, blockers, and next action if its recorded state has changed.
6. Replace `latest_session_work.md` once with changes, verification, pending work, and next entry point.
7. Update durable docs only when warranted and `project_diary.md` only for significant decisions or lessons.
8. If meaningful project files changed, run `git add .` and commit with `git commit -m "[auto commit] <summary>"`.

If no meaningful project files changed, no need to refresh `latest_session_work.md`.

Every completed session should leave honest status, bounded changes, current verification, preserved user work, and a clear continuation point.
